am i responsice 

Sports Quiz is a web application created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It aims to test sporting knowledge across a wide range of sports and for enjoyment. The quiz will teach the user a few things they did not know about sport and also reaffirm what they do know. 

- User Stories


| User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| As a user I want to be able to easily navigate the quiz | The quiz has clear instructions on how to move from point to point. |
| As a user I want to know when I am right or wrong | The user will be notified if they are right or wrong by selecting the answer and being met with red or green. |
| The user should be able to use an array of different sized devices | The site is fully responsive and reacts to different screen sizes without sacrificing content or integrity |
| As a user I want all links to work | All links are working proper |
| As a user I want to understand the rules of the quiz | The rules are clearly displayed when the rules button is clicked |
| As a user I want to trust the information that is being displayed to me |



## Site Skeleton

I used the software Balsamiq to draw up simple wireframes to help with the design of the site. The following screenshots show the desktop browser and mobile browser (iPhone 5) for the index page, gallery and contact us page.


## Screenshots of the site

## Features

- Homepage
 
picture of homepage

The homepage is fully responsive and allows access to the rules and quiz.

The Homepage is nicely coloured and has clear offset from the background to the content.

- Rules 

A javascript function that displays the rules when they are clicked. The rules button disappears when clicked and the rules are displayed. When the begin button is pressed the rules will disappear and the quiz will start.

- Quiz 

The quiz is simple and consistent and took major inspiration from the WebDevSimplified youtube page. It displays the question and then has four answer buttons with one correct answer and 3 incorrect answers. When the incorrect option is chosen the color will go red and when it is correct the colour will go green. 

- Timer 

There is a 5 minute (300 second) timer operated by javascript. When the clock reaches 0 the page will refresh and the user will need to restart the quiz.

- Features left to implement 

Unfortunatly, there are a lot of features I would have liked to implement but due to time constraints and general inexperience with javascript i was unable to feature them in this project. 
I would have liked to have a score counter and also a final score at the end of the quiz. I would have liked to animate the page with various javascript.
